# Survey-Website
The application was built for my IFT 1015 - Programming I course and is used to plan team meetings. Each member of the team can enter their availability and the application will record their answers. Made in collaboration with [Justin Michaud](https://github.com/justinmichaud5).

# What I Learned
* How to code an interactive calendar in HTML
* How to record the information the participants entered in the application
* Intermediate programming concepts, such as: functional decomposition, events, web development
